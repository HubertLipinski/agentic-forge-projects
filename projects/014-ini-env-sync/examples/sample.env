# examples/sample.env
# This is a sample .env file to demonstrate the capabilities of the INI/ENV Sync Tool.

# --- Basic Key-Value Pairs ---
# These will be converted to top-level keys in the INI file.
APP_NAME=INI-ENV Sync Tool
APP_VERSION=1.0.0
DEBUG_MODE=true

# --- Quoted Values ---
# The parser correctly handles different quoting styles.
# Quotes are necessary for values with spaces, special characters, or that are empty.
GREETING="Hello, World!"
EMPTY_VALUE=""
SPACED_VALUE="  this value has leading and trailing spaces  "
SPECIAL_CHARS="value with # and = signs"

# --- Keys with Prefixes ---
# These keys will be grouped into sections in the INI file.
# The default delimiter is '_', so 'DATABASE_HOST' becomes [DATABASE] host=...
DATABASE_HOST=localhost
DATABASE_PORT=5432
DATABASE_USER=prod_user
DATABASE_PASSWORD="a_very_secure_password_with_!@#$"

# --- Nested-style Prefixes ---
# Keys with multiple delimiters are also handled correctly.
# 'API_AUTH_TOKEN' becomes [API] AUTH_TOKEN=...
API_AUTH_TOKEN=xyz123abc456
API_RETRY_COUNT=3
API_TIMEOUT_MS=15000

# --- Keys with dots and hyphens ---
# These are valid in .env files and will be preserved or transformed based on settings.
# When converting to INI, these will become top-level keys.
# When converting from INI, these might be generated from section-less keys.
