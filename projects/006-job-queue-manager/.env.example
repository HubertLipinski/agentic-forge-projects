# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Job Queue Manager - Example Environment Variables
#
# This file serves as a template for the required environment variables.
# Copy this file to a new file named `.env` in the root directory
# and replace the example values with your actual configuration.
# The application uses the `dotenv` package to automatically load these
# variables when run in a development environment.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# --- Server Configuration ---
# The port on which the Fastify API server will listen for incoming requests.
# Default: 3000
SERVER_PORT=3000

# The host interface the server will bind to.
# Use '0.0.0.0' to accept connections on all available network interfaces (common for Docker).
# Use '127.0.0.1' to only accept connections from the local machine.
# Default: '127.0.0.1'
SERVER_HOST=127.0.0.1


# --- Worker Configuration ---
# The number of concurrent worker processes to run.
# This is not yet implemented in the current version but is planned for future scaling.
# For now, this value is informational.
# WORKER_CONCURRENCY=1


# --- Redis Configuration ---
# The connection string for the Redis server. This is the primary data store for jobs.
# The format is `redis[s]://[[username][:password]@][host][:port][/db-number]`
#
# Example for a local Redis instance without a password:
REDIS_URL=redis://127.0.0.1:6379
#
# Example for a production Redis instance with a password:
# REDIS_URL=redis://:your-password@your-redis-host.com:6379/0


# --- Logging Configuration ---
# The minimum level of logs to be output by the application (server and worker).
# Recommended values, from least to most verbose:
# 'fatal', 'error', 'warn', 'info', 'debug', 'trace'
#
# Production recommendation: 'info'
# Development recommendation: 'debug'
# Default: 'info'
LOG_LEVEL=info


# --- Node.js Environment ---
# Sets the environment mode for Node.js.
# This can affect the behavior of some dependencies and is good practice to set.
# Common values are 'development', 'production', or 'test'.
NODE_ENV=development
