## Projects

| # | Project | Description | Category | Difficulty |
|---|---------|-------------|----------|------------|
| 015 | [Webhook Relay Service](projects/015-webhook-relay-service/) | A standalone, self-hostable API server that receives webhooks from various sources and securely relays them to internal or firewalled services. It provides a public endpoint, validation, request logging, and a configurable retry mechanism, simplifying webhook integration for developers without exposing their local or staging environments to the public internet. | api-server | intermediate |
| 014 | [INI/ENV Sync Tool](projects/014-ini-env-sync/) | A command-line tool for converting and synchronizing configuration files between INI and .env formats. It intelligently handles comments, sections, and nested keys, making it ideal for developers managing different configuration styles across multiple environments or applications. | file-converter | intermediate |
| 013 | [JSDoc-to-CLI](projects/013-jsdoc-to-cli/) | A zero-configuration CLI tool that automatically generates a command-line interface for any JavaScript function. It parses JSDoc comments to create flags from @param tags and handles argument parsing, type casting, and help text generation. Ideal for developers who want to expose utility scripts as CLIs without writing boilerplate argument parsing code. | code-generator | beginner |
| 012 | [Log Stream Aggregator](projects/012-log-stream-aggregator/) | A lightweight Node.js utility for aggregating multiple real-time log streams (e.g., from files, stdin, network sockets) into a single, unified, and structured JSON output stream. It's designed for developers and system administrators who need to centralize logs from various microservices or processes for easier monitoring and analysis without a heavy log-shipping agent like Logstash or Fluentd. | data-pipeline | intermediate |
| 011 | [Markdown to JSON with Front-Matter](projects/011-md-to-json-frontmatter/) | A lightweight, zero-dependency CLI tool and library for converting Markdown files with YAML front-matter into structured JSON. It's designed for developers building static site generators, content management systems, or any script that needs to process Markdown content programmatically. | file-converter | beginner |
| 010 | [Stream Fork-Join](projects/010-stream-fork-join/) | A Node.js utility for forking a readable stream into multiple, independent writable streams and optionally joining them back into a single readable stream after all forks have completed. It's designed for scenarios where you need to process a single data source in parallel (e.g., writing to different files, sending to multiple APIs, performing different transformations) without reading the source multiple times. | data-pipeline | intermediate |
| 009 | [CSV Stream Transformer](projects/009-csv-stream-transformer/) | A lightweight, stream-based Node.js library for transforming large CSV files with minimal memory usage. It provides a configurable pipeline for mapping columns, filtering rows, and applying custom transformations, making it ideal for ETL tasks, data cleaning, and preprocessing data for ingestion into databases or other systems. | data-pipeline | intermediate |
| 008 | [Matrix Solver JS](projects/008-matrix-solver-js/) | A pure JavaScript linear algebra library for solving large and sparse systems of linear equations (Ax=b) using iterative methods. Optimized for performance and memory efficiency in Node.js environments without native code compilation. Ideal for scientific computing, data analysis, and simulation tasks where matrices are too large for direct inversion. | math-tool | advanced |
| 007 | [JSON File Merger](projects/007-json-file-merger/) | A lightweight command-line utility for intelligently merging multiple JSON or JSON5 files into a single output file. It supports deep merging of objects and concatenation of arrays, making it ideal for managing configuration files across different environments (e.g., base.json, development.json, production.json). | utility | beginner |
| 006 | [Job Queue Manager](projects/006-job-queue-manager/) | A lightweight, Redis-backed, persistent job queue API server for Node.js. It's designed for developers who need a simple but reliable way to offload background tasks (like sending emails, processing images, or generating reports) from their main application thread. It provides a RESTful API to enqueue, check the status of, and manage jobs without the complexity of larger message queue systems. | api-server | intermediate |
| 005 | [LLM Stream Parser](projects/005-llm-stream-parser/) | A lightweight, zero-dependency Node.js utility for parsing and normalizing streaming responses from various Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Cohere. It handles different streaming formats (SSE, chunked JSON) and provides a consistent, asynchronous iterable interface for developers building real-time AI applications. | ai-wrapper | intermediate |
| 004 | [Discord Quote Bot](projects/004-discord-quote-bot/) | A simple Discord bot that allows users to save and retrieve memorable quotes from their server. Useful for preserving funny moments, important discussion points, or inside jokes within a community. Anyone moderating or participating in a Discord server can use it. | discord-bot | beginner |
| 003 | [Git Changed Files Reporter](projects/003-git-changed-files-reporter/) | A Node.js utility to report on files changed in a Git repository since a specified reference (commit, tag, or branch). Useful for CI/CD pipelines to determine which files need processing or testing. | utility | beginner |
| 002 | [Simple Configuration File Generator](projects/002-simple-config-generator/) | A command-line tool that generates basic configuration files (e.g., JSON, YAML) based on a predefined template and user-provided values. Useful for quickly scaffolding configuration for new projects, services, or applications. | code-generator | beginner |
| 001 | [Log Level Changer CLI](projects/001-log-level-changer/) | A simple command-line tool to dynamically change the log level of a running Node.js application without restarting it. Useful for debugging in production or staging environments by temporarily increasing log verbosity. Developers and operations teams can use this to quickly inspect application behavior. | testing-tool | beginner |
